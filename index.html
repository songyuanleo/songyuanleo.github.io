Hello! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science within the Faculty of Environment, Science and Economy at the <b><a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/"> University of Exeter</a></b>, U.K. Fortunately, I am supervised by <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/jh815">Dr. Jia Hu</a> and <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/gm321">Prof. Geyong Min</a>.

<br><br>

Before that, I received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in Computer Science and Technology from the <b><a href="http://www.bupt.edu.cn">Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</a></b>, China, in 2018 and 2021, respectively. During my Master's career, I was lucky enough to work with  <a href="http://www.cup.edu.cn/cise/szdw/js2/170715.htm"> Prof. Jiwei Huang</a> and <a href="https://int.bupt.edu.cn/content/content.php?p=6_16_134"> Prof. Bo Cheng</a> at the <a href="http://sklnst.bupt.edu.cn/"> State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology</a>, Beijing, China.
  
<br><br>

My research interests span the areas of <b>distributed systems and networks</b>, <b>services/cloud/edge Computing</b>, <b>applied machine learning</b>, and <b>QoS evaluation and optimization</b>. My research results have been published in highly-competitive conferences and journals, including IEEE Transactions on
Cognitive Communications and Networking, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, IEEE ICWS, IEEE SCC, IEEE ISPA. My research is supported by EPSRC, EU Horizon, National Natural Science Foundation of China, University of Exeter, etc.

My CV can be found <a href="">here</a>. Feel free to drop me an email if you share common interests.

Over the years, I have worked on  performance modeling and resource management problems of various computing systems, such as web services, cloud data centers, and big data processing systems. My recent focus on distributed machine learning algorithms and  systems leads me to address following exciting research areas and questions.
-->
<br>
<br>

<li> Privacy-preserving learning systems by synthetic data: 
how to maximize the knowledge of  while maintaining data privacy ? I am exploring the deep generative models to synthesize data. </li>

<li>  Robust learning systems:
how to make learning algorithms robust against adversaries that maliciously manipulate data input? I am designing practical strategies and theories against attackers, e.g., free riders, and thief. </li>
 
<li >Federated machine learning systems:
how to decentralizedly learn deep learning models on heterogeneous clients who contentiously encounter new learning tasks and data domain shift? I am working on domain adaptation, and continual learning in FL. </li>
